            <p>As awareness around mental illness has increased, so has the price of getting necessary treatment. Even as resources for mental health have expanded, community hospitals remain a primary source for treatment. <p>
            	<a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201100402?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a study published in Psychiatric Services</a>, nearly one in four hospital visits in 2004 involved mental or substance use disorders. In New York state, the charges associated with treatment for depression have significantly increased since 2009. While hospitals provide necessary treatment for patients with depression, especially those in crisis, the increasing costs could prevent people from accessing these resources.</br> </p>

            

        <section>
            <p>The New York State Department of Health classifies cases of depression in hospitals in two categories: “Depression except Major Depressive Disorder” and “Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and other unspecified psychosis.” The level of severity is also organized by mild, moderate, major, and extreme. As severity increases, so does the price of treatment. For “extreme” cases of MDD and depression, the average cost is almost five times more than the treatment for “mild” cases. The more severe the depression, the more resources are required, which increases hospital charges.</br></p>

            <p>However, Debra Bremer, RPh, a clinical pharmacist at South Oaks Hospital in Amityville, New York, says patients with severe mental illness usually benefit the most from hospital resources. </br>

<br>“There's no one who just comes in [for] hospitalization [solely for] depression. There’s usually other things [such as] anxiety, substances, [or] bipolar [disorder],” Bremer explained. </br>

<br>For cases of depression or psychosis, patients are usually past the point of trying lifestyle modifications. <p>
            	<a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201100402?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patients who need complex drug therapy, psychotherapy, short-term detoxification, or crisis care rely on hospitals for these services. </a> Therefore, hospitals and inpatient facilities provide the opportunity for specialized resources, in addition to medical intervention.</br>

<br>“When they're inpatient, we're going to try to give them coping skills to learn how to deal with their symptoms, which they might not get on the outside. They're going to have talk therapy, art therapy, [and] pet therapy. So we're going to include everything and also teach coping skills in addition to being observed while [they’re] on medication,” Bremer said. </br>

<br>Hospitals can also set up support for patients once they are discharged, such as an Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) plan. An ACT team can provide care and make sure that someone is following their treatment plan at home rather than in a hospital. </br>

<br>However, these necessary resources are steadily becoming more expensive in New York. </br>

<br>Data from the New York State Department of Health demonstrates a significant increase in average charges for depression care. In 2009, the average charges for depression treatment (excluding MDD) was $16,584. In 2021, this price jumped to $39,792, a nearly 140% increase. Similarly, the average price for MDD treatment experienced a 138% increase, going from $26,622 in 2009, to $63,500 in 2021. </br>

 <p>While this data can be a useful indicator of price trends, it does have some limitations. One limitation is the lack of information between 2018-2020, which New York state plans to release later this year. In addition, data does not account for length of hospital stays, a key factor when considering price. Similarly, information on the types of treatments patients received is not included, making it impossible to break down costs by treatment. Despite these limitations, the steady increase in price demonstrates that health care costs for depression treatment have significantly risen over a 12-year period. </br>
<br>As reported in Psychiatric Services,  the costs associated with psychiatric disorders and inpatient treatment are largely understudied, leaving many unanswered questions about who is responsible for the bill. For patients with private insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare, these rates are often negotiated. However, increasing prices leaves individuals without health insurance vulnerable to being charged the full rate. </br>

<br>The study also highlights that a lack of economic transparency, as well as the gap between reimbursement cost to deliver care, could result in inpatient treatment for mental illness becoming unavailable. Without these resources, alternatives such as correctional facilities could  become an alternative treatment facility for people with severe mental illness. </br>

<br>Bremer expresses that at every hospital, costs are always an issue because the hospital wants to make a profit off of patients. Yet, she also recognizes the consequences that higher health care costs could cause, especially for those who are the least able to afford it. </br>

<br>“I think it’s a huge problem…You go to New York City [and] more than half, I’d probably say, of the homeless people [have a] mental health issue. So the cost of not treating these patients is more significant if you take everything into consideration and look at the hidden cost, like people living on the streets, [and ]the things like crime…” Bremer states. </br>

<br>Although cultural knowledge around mental health resources has improved over the past few decades, the rising price for depression treatment in New York demonstrates that there are still barriers that inhibit individuals from receiving necessary care. While the full social impact of higher hospital costs cannot be fully evaluated with the limited data available, it provides valuable insight on the multiple factors contributing to mental health care access. </br></p>
